### Analysis of Wines
```{r echo=FALSE}
df.wines <- read.csv(file = "whitewines.csv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
total.wines <- nrow(df.wines)
alc.content.over.eleven <- round((length(which(df.wines$alcohol > 11))/total.wines) *100,1) #https://www.statology.org/round-in-r/
highest.alc.content <- max(df.wines$alcohol)
```
There are a total of **`r total.wines`** wines in this data set. **`r alc.content.over.eleven`**% of the wines have an alcohol content over 11%. The highest alcohol content of any wine is **`r highest.alc.content`**%.

The scatter plot below illustrates the correlation between alcohol and sugar content.
