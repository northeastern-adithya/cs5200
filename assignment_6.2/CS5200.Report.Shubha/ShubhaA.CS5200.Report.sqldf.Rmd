We recorded a total number of `r totalVisit` visits across `r distinctRestaurants` different restaurants.The median amount spent for a visit across all restaurants is `r amountMedian` (Ïƒ = `r amountStdDev`).The least number of visits visits were to `r restaurantWithLeastVisit`.The average amount spent in a visit was `r meanAmount` and `r percentageOfGroupsConsumingWine`% of all parties consumed wine.The average size of a party was `r averagePartySize`.
